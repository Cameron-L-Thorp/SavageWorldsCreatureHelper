# SavageWorldsCreatureHelper
A personal project to input, edit, save and access the information for the Savage World RPG
This project was created in order to practice adding, updating and pulling data from a server outside of the solution, using entity framework.
Currently I am working to create another version that can function completely offline, relying on CSVs to store data.
